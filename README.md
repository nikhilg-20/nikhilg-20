# 👋 Hello, I’m Nikhil Ghugare  
_Data Scientist in the Making | Cloud Explorer | Insight Enthusiast_

I’m a passionate data science graduate student at Seattle University, blending curiosity with code to turn complex data into meaningful stories and smart solutions.

With a background in computer engineering and experience in machine learning, cloud platforms, and full-stack development, I thrive on solving real-world problems — from fraud detection to climate analysis. Whether it’s designing predictive models or building intuitive web applications, I enjoy working at the intersection of data, technology, and creativity.

💡 I believe in learning by doing, collaborating across disciplines, and using data for good.

When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring new research papers, visualizing insights, or just brainstorming the next big project.
